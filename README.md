# In Matthew 16:24-25, Jesus Christ gives us very clear instructions on how to surrender to his loving authority:

Then Jesus told his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.”
